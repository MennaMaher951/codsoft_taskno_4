## Sales Prediction with Simple Linear Regression

This repository implements a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending data.

**Data:**

The model is trained on the "advertising.csv" dataset containing information on TV, Radio, Newspaper advertising expenditures and achieved sales.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Heatmaps and scatter plots reveal correlations between advertising channels and sales.
* Outlier analysis is conducted to assess data quality.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

* A simple linear regression model is trained using the training set.
* Model performance is evaluated on both training and testing sets using RMSE and R^2 metrics.
* Cross-validation could be implemented for more robust evaluation.

**Discussion:**

* The model achieves an R^2 score of 0.84 on the testing set, indicating a good fit.
* Limitations include potential overfitting and model assumptions.
* Further improvements could involve feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or exploring other model types.

**Next Steps:**

* Refine the model based on the discussed improvements.
* Consider incorporating additional features or data sources.
* Explore more advanced regression techniques for enhanced accuracy.

**Contributions:**

Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the code, suggesting enhancements, or sharing findings.
